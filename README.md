# What is Let's Learn Finance?
Our goal is to enable young students to learn about the importance of personal finance and basic economics. We believe in the empowering freedom that financial education offers, and so we aim to provide a forever free, well designed, open-source economics curriculum that anyone can use, build upon, without having to credit or cite us - because economics and personal finance is for everyone.

## Who is on the team?
The current team consists of two members, Cameron Fink and Jonas Kobza.

## Where can I find the content?
Content can be found on both our GitHub and our website, https://docs.letslearnfinance.org.
