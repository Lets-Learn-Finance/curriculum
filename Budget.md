## Importance of keeping a budget##

It's important to keep a budget because it enables you to make smarter financial decisions, and create goals that help you aim towards a better financial condition.

Budgeting is an essential part of personal finance, and is often one of the easiest ways to learn more about a smarter approach to money.

## How to keep a budget

The simplest way to keep a budget is to estimate your income and your expenses, then subtract expenses from income. However, that misses a lot of the finer details,
and can often lead to forgetting about aspects of the projected expenses, and doesn't account for other financial obligations, such as saving money or for 
emergencies.

Here's an example of a budget for one month:



| **Income**           | **Expenses**           |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| Job - $1000          | Food - $250            |
| Tutoring - $200      | Clothes - $150         |
|                      | Entertainment - $50    |
|                      | Internet - $50         |
|                      | Rent - $600            |
| Total income - $1200 | Total expenses - $1100 |

In this budget, $100 is left in a monthly balance to account for unanticipated spending and saving.

By budgeting, you can allocate money to a particular expense, and estimate what you will need to make to spend a certain amount.
