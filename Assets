#Assets vs. Liabilities

Assets are anything owned by a person, group, or organisation that has value. An asset can be cash, it could be investments, or it could be non-traditional stores 
of value, such as valuable sneakers, collectible cards, or even a college degree.

For this article, we'll focus on things that have values that can be quantified, or have a value in dollars that they could be sold for - in this case, US dollars.

Counteracting assets are liabilities - something you are responsible for. When discussing personal finance, liabilities are often debts - money you owe to somebody 
or something else - but can also be other circumstances that subtract negatively from the value of your assets.

Net worth is the value of all assets a person or organisation owns, minus the liabilities they owe. In this case, the variable a represents assets and the variable 
d represents liabilities. N is the net worth calculated using this equation:
a−d=Na - d = Na−d=N

Net worth is important because it provides a quantitative assessment of your finances, and compares the money you owe to the money you have in total. As a single 
statistic, it provides a general overview of a person or organisation's financial condition, and the health of their finances.

#Benefit of non-liquid assets

Non-liquid assets - things you own that aren't cash - are often beneficial because the value of non-liquid assets can go up over time, whereas due to inflation, 
the value of a dollar will decrease over time.

That's why people often invest in things like stocks, bonds, or non-traditional stores of value, in the hope that their value relative to the dollar or another 
currency will go up over time. However, it is not a good idea to have no cash holdings, as cash is the most used medium of exchange, and therefore is often the 
desired way to pay for things.
